# OsuStoryboardConstructor

**Status: In active development**

## To-do list
*(In order of priority)*

**In proccess:**
- None

**In plans:**
- Moving objects within the object tree.
- Create "Attribute" field in json project file, which will contain unique parameters for the object. (For example for sprite, it's position, rotate and scale).
- Fix disclosure of all groups after any interaction with object.
- Interaction with several objects at the same time (Probably partial?).
- Begin writing the code for storyboard part.
- Create sprite object and particle system object.

**In ideas:**
- Ð¡reate documentation on the use of the program
- Create text object with text-to-image conversion system.
- System of visual customization of editor.
- Add localization for several languages (currently there are people for: Russian, Spanish)
- Optimizing the reading of a json project file (Save it in a thread rather than open/close it?)

- Support for collaborative development of the storyboard. (In fact, in the very-very-very distant plans, I won't think about it for at least half a year or year after the release).
